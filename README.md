</ul>
We were a group of friends who decided to participate in this hackathon in order to learn new things, and participating in our first hackathon ever was a bit of an exciting and thrilling experience. Our idea is dedicated to the safety and empowerment of women, especially in the transport sector. We had a lot of features and ideas surrounding this project, which you can read about in the following paragraphs.</p>
<p>
<h2>About the Project</h2>
<p>Women are constantly plagued with uncertainties and worries about their safety when riding alone in a male-driven cab, and women drivers are always on the edge when driving around male passengers. The involvement of women in the transport sector is meager when compared to men, and therefore, in order to encourage women in this sector, we had come up with an idea that only allows women to travel, in cabs and taxis driven by other women. This can also be used for the safe travel of children below the age of 18 years.</p>
<h3>Features which we wished to implement</h3>
<p><ul>
<li>Each driver, before registering with our service, must provide us with details such as a copy of their driverâ€™s license, Aadhar number, etc.</li>
<li>Drivers registered with our service can operate flexibly at their own schedule with a minimum of 3 working hours and shall earn 50% of their fares, excluding fuel charges.</li>
<li>While booking a ride, the customer needs to provide access to their current location and contact, so that the driver can communicate and reach the destination without any difficulties.</li>
<li>The customer will be made aware while booking a ride about the live video and mic recording in the cab. Therefore, should the customer or driver encounter any incident, this recording can be of aid to them.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Epilogue</h2>
<p>Towards the end of this hackathon, our team came to learn about many new ideas and technologies which we could use for this as well as future projects. We are very thankful to all the seniors, panelists, and other teams who had stopped by and discussed in great length about our project, as well as helping out with suggestions and ideas for future hacks. Most importantly, we would like to thank DSC  VIT Vellore for providing us with this amazing opportunity. Sadly, due to time constraints, we were unable to carry out some of the features we wished to implement. Nevertheless, we had a great time coding and designing this website, and we hope you like them as well!</p>
